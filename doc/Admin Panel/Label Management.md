#Label Management

This part of the admin system lets you setup the desired labels per overview page. You have to setup the labels per page as these can be different,<br/>
meaning you setup labels for the Scenes overview page, the Designs overview page, the Images overview page and the Projects overview page.

To create a new label you select the “Add root label” button on the left side of the page. Enter a name for the new label and hit enter or click the arrow button.

You can expanse the labels by adding child labels to the root labels. To add a child label click on “Add child label” on the right side of the page.

If you want to change the name of the label afterwards you can alter the name on the right side of the page and afterwards hit “Save this label”.<br/>
If you want to delete the label you just click “Delete this Label”, XPO will give you an warning message if you are sure you want to delete the label.

If you want to move the label created label to a different label you have to click on “Move this label”.<br/>
A popup will appear in which you can select the new root label to add this child label to. You can also make this label a new root label by click “make this label a root”.
