#Users

The users are the people that have access to your XPO system. To add a new user just click “Add new user” and enter a name and the persons email address.

When a new user is created you still need to setup that users password. Click on “change password”, enter a password in the popup and hit “Save this user” afterwards.<br />
The passwords aren’t visible because of security and privacy policies, meaning if a user has lost his/her password a new password has to be setup by the admin/owner of the XPO system.

If a user tries to login with a wrong password multiple times in a short period of time, they will locked out of their account. The admin/owner of the XPO account will be able to see if a user is locked out.<br />
The “Islockedout” button will be set to “On”. If they change it back to “off” the user will be able to login again.
An admin or owner can deny a user entry to the XPO system by clicking the “Isapproved” button.
<br />They can also setup a user account for a certain time period by selecting a date in the “Validuntil” part.

When a new user is created he/she will not see anything when logged in to the XPO system unless certain roles/rights have been added to that user account.
