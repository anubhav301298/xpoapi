#Watermark Management

The Watermark Management page lets you setup a watermark over your scenes, designs or images. This could for example be a logo of your company or a demo watermark.

By clicking the “Add New Watermark” button you can setup a new watermark.<br />
Choose a watermark image by clicking “Select image”. You can setup multiple watermarks for different purposes.<br />
You can apply them to different roles and to different file types (scenes, images, designs and projects).
