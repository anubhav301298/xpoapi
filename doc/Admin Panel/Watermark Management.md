#Watermark Management

The Watermark Management page lets you setup a watermark to place over your scenes, designs or images. This could for example be a logo of your company or a demo watermark.

You can setup a new watermark by clicking the “Add New Watermark” button.<br />
Choose an image to use as watermark by clicking “Select image”. You can add multiple watermarks for different purposes.<br />
You can apply watermarks to different roles and to different file types (scenes, images, designs and projects).
