#Mail Templates Management

PicarioXPO sends out generated emails to users when a new account has been created, a password has been reset or a scene request has been finished.<br/>
In the Mail Templates Management page you can modify the text of these emails to your liking. Furthermore you can change the mail send from address and the send from name.
