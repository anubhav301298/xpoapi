#Color Management

The Color Management part of the Admin Settings System lets you add and modify color charts which can be used in the designer.<br />
These are colors only so they exists out of RGB or LAB values. These color charts are mostly used by paint manufacturers and suppliers. <br />
The Designer module also has a “free” mode in which you can select all colors in the color spectrum along with selecting your own desired colors based upon a RGB value.
