#Custom Properties

Properties are extra information or extra search and filter options to add to your scenes, designs, images and projects.

There are two types of properties which are global properties and local properties. <br/>
The global properties are properties that you can also search or filter files on. <br/>
The local properties are used only to add extra information to for example a scene or design.

The properties can have different types: a yes/no value, a time and date stamp, a static dropdown menu (which you can add the different options to), a hyperlink, a number or a plain text form.

The created properties can be modified, setup and enhanced on the right side of the page. <br>
You can name it, add a description, change its type, make it a mandatory property, toggle its visibility as filter and toggle its visibility in the overview page underneath the properties.
