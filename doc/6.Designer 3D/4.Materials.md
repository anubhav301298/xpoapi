#Materials
On the right side of the page the available materials and material properties are displayed which you can use to modify the chosen model file.

####Materials
The materials are images, with render settings, that can be used to modify the meshes of the model. Simply click an image and the selected mesh will be transformed using the selected material file.<br /> You can also use the same sort, filter, displaytype and search options like with the model files.

####Material Properties
If a material isnâ€™t visualized properly on an mesh in a model file you can change the material properties to your needs. The rendering info from the material info screen is used as the standard values.<br />
You can change the width and height of a material (in millimeters). You can also change the repeat for the pattern to x amount, where x is the number of repeats on the x or y axis.<br />
Furthermore you can flip the material on the x and y axis. The placing point lets you change the coordinates from where the material starts.<br />
You can select the placing point from the list, change it with the X and Y values or just move the blue square around through the area. The material will automatically interact with the changes you make to the material properties.
