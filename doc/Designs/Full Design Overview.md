####Overview
The Overview tab shows a slightly larger version of the specific design image. If any attachments are added to the file these will also be shown in the overview.<br/>

####Settings
The settings tab shows the display name of the design file, which you can alter if desired. It also lets you add a description to the design file.<br/>
Furthermore the Reference ID is mentioned over here which developers need when using the Render or Data API. When a design file has been <br/>
modified outside of PicarioXPO you can use the overwrite scene option to exchange it with another version of the same design file.

####Security
The security tab lets you add an owner or a specific role (or roles) to the design file. When a specific role has been added to the design file, <br/>
only the users which also have that/those role(s) assigned to their account can see and use the design file.

<b>Important:</b> If a design doesn’t have any security roles everybody will be able to see the design.

A default scene file can be assigned to a design file. The design file will automatically be rendered on top of this default scene file.<br/>
The visualized design on top of the default scene will be visible in the overview tab and when switching from 2D to 3D on the Design Overview page.
