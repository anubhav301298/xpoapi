#Search
In the showroom you can search in different ways to get the results you want. <br/>
Each design has it's own design query that contains all the words that can be used to find that design. <br/>

The design query is based on the following fields:

  + The display name of a design
  + The description of a design
  + The storage name of a design
  + The labels of a design
  + The reference id of a design
  + The id of a design
  + The values of all the properties of a design
