#Objects

The available objects in the scene file will be displayed either on the right side of the page or at the bottom of the page, depending on your screen resolution .<br />
The objects highlight the areas in the scene file which can be modified using different colors or designs.<br />
You can either use only colors (color only objects) or colors and designs (texture objects), depending on how the scene file is created.<br />
When you hover over an object the name will be displayed.
