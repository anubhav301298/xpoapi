#Objects

Depending on your monitors resolution the available objects in the scene file will be displayed either on the right side of the page or at the bottom of the page.<br />
The objects highlight the areas in the scene file which can be modified using different colors or designs.<br />
Depending on how the scene file is created you can either use only colors (color only objects) or colors and designs (texture objects).<br />
When you hover on top of an object the name will be displayed.
