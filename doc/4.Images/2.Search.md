#Search
In the showroom you can search in different ways to get the results you want. <br/>
Each image has it's own image query that contains all the words that can be used to find that image. <br/>

The image query is based on the following fields:

  + The display name of a image
  + The description of a image
  + The storage name of a image
  + The labels of a image
  + The reference id of a image
  + The id of a image
  + The values of all the properties of a image
