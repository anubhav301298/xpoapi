#XPO Developer API

XPO uses a developer API that allows developers to extract information from their XPO environment.

In order to use the developer API you need an API key. This API key can be found in XPO on the account page if you have the right to use API.<br />
This API key can be used in two ways:

1.	Add the API key to the querystring(?apiKey=1234).
2.	Add the API key to the http header (the header name is the same as the querystring parameter).
